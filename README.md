# 🐍 Python Basics – Sprint 1 Project  

This repository contains my first project from the Data Analysis Bootcamp.  
It focuses on the **fundamentals of Python programming**, applying the concepts learned during the first sprint.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook where I practiced:  
- Understanding and working with **different data types** (int, float, bool, string, list)  
- **Type conversions** and arithmetic operations  
- Implementing **error handling** with `try-except` blocks  
- **String manipulation**: `format()`, f-strings, `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`  
- Working with **lists** and using slicing  
- Writing **loops** (`for` and `while`) to iterate over collections  
- Applying **conditional statements** to create branching logic  
- Documenting my work with **comments** and clear explanations
